# Traffic demand prediction

**Max. score:** 100

Cities worldwide are increasingly turning to AI-powered solutions to tackle the issue of traffic congestion. This problem disrupts the smooth flow of transportation and poses a significant barrier to economic growth. To address this challenge effectively, the first step is to understand travel demand and patterns within urban areas comprehensively. By harnessing the power of AI, cities, and regions aim to gather critical insights into transportation dynamics. This will enable them to implement data-driven strategies and solutions to alleviate traffic congestion and promote more efficient mobility. Ultimately, this endeavor will foster economic development and prosperity.

## Task

Design a system that helps us provide valuable insights into passenger travel patterns, booking behavior, and trip cancellations, which can be used for various analyses and predict demand in the travel industry.
